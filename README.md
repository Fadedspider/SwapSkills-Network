## Problem Statement
**Skill Swap Platform**
**Overview:**
Develop a Skill Swap Platform — a mini application that enables users to list their skills and request others in return.

**Features:**
- Basic info: Name, location (optional), profile photo (optional)
- List of skills offered
- List of skills wanted
- Availability (e.g., weekends, evenings)
- User can make their profile public or private.
- Users can browse or search others by skill (e.g., “Photoshop” or “Excel”)
- Request & Accept Swaps:
  - Accept or reject swap offers
  - Show current and pending swap requests
  - Ratings or feedback after a swap
  - The user is also able to delete the swap request if it is not accepted.
- Admin Role:
  - Reject inappropriate or spammy skill descriptions.
  - Ban users who violate platform policies.
  - Monitor pending, accepted, or cancelled swaps.
  - Send platform-wide messages (e.g., feature updates, downtime alerts).
  - Download reports of user activity, feedback logs, and swap stats.
